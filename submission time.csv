It was the easiest fan I've installed, most of the work can be done on a table, only the wiring overhead. It is light, perfectly balanced, whisper quiet and just the right conversation piece for the room. I took down an 80lb fan. Yes, 80lbs. While that one was substantial and sturdy, it does not seem to be made better. The MinkaAire is simply made of lightweight materials, not cheap ones. After removal of the old fan, the total install time on this one was about 15 minutes.",2014-04-24

The fan feels solid and not cheap even though the blades are plastic it is a very nice product and I would buy it again. The only thing I would like to tell people is that the remote receiver box goes inside the fan just below the junction box ,and if you don't know this is very confusing but there is a small shelf to fit this in located at the bottom of the mounting bracket(magic)it will not fit any other way. I also want people to know that the dimmer control is also the same button as the light button,holding it down longer makes the light dim. I mounted mine close to the ceiling and removed the extension it looks great and is very solid on the ceiling even on the highest speed.My family loves it,and I bet yours will to especially if your looking for a ceiling fan that doesn't look like it belongs in your grandmothers house.",2015-08-08

We bought one of these fans and it made such a dramatic statement in the room, we decided to get a second one.  It looks even more impressive in person than the image shows.  It's super quiet, has a great remote and lots of variations with fan speeds (9 instead of 3, plus variable cycles).  The extra rake angle on the blades create quite a breeze too.  The LED light is pretty bright at the top setting.  If I am looking for something to complain about, I prefer a whiter light.  Love, love, love.",2016-10-31

I have spent days trying to get the remote and wifi to work properly with very poor results. It's also over priced considering the cheap plastic blades and tiny remote. They also have the nerve to charge an additional $150 for the wifi module and they cripple the light on/off function. The installation is very tedious due to the tight constraints of the large control module which leaves you less than a half inch space at the top to contain all the wires and plugs that are needed to connect this fan. The plugs are also small, delicate and difficult to connect especially if you are high up on a ladder. There is also a plug on the ring that connects to the cowling covering the motor that refused to line up due to the flimsy clip holding it in place. Had to wrap electrical tape to hold it in place and only use one screw in the cowling so there was enough play in order to get it to line up. I also have an H series fan from them and it works flawless (it should for $1000) except for the light cover which was warped but they promptly replaced it. Customer service is excellent but fans are very overpriced and The L series has many issues and they are both difficult to install.",2017-04-06

/p/Hampton-Bay-Vaurgas-44-in-LED-Indoor-Brushed-Nickel-Ceiling-Fan-with-Light-Kit-68144/207046702,207046702,"This fan looks very nice and all of the parts were included in the package. Initially I did not like the engineering aspect of having to blindly attach the fan blade support pieces to the motor through a hole in the housing using a screw driver , but the process went much smoother on the second fan that I installed. They run smooth and quietly, and attaching the fan blades to the support pieces was as snap (literally) easy to assemble and feels very secure.",2017-01-11
/p/Hunter-Builder-Low-Profile-52-in-Indoor-Snow-White-Ceiling-Fan-53326/207094017,207094017,"The appearance was what I wanted, although I'm not sure "low profile" is a true description. I'm disappointed in the amount of light this produces; it's noticeably dimmer than our previous fixture but I should have expected that with the lower wattage bulbs required. It's a replacement fan and the installation was done by a professional so I can't really say much about how easy it was to install.",2016-08-09

Edaquate cooling for the speeds that it has. A bit noisy at lowest speed with motor and electrical noise. Needs better light bulbs, as the ones came with it are just too dim and yellow (cold temp). I changed them out with the 5000K bulbs and it is much better lighting now. Overall, it is a good fan for the price.",2016-09-13

The matte silver finish is an awesome updated finish that can simply transcend any room. The 46 inch size is nice because it does the job for big or small rooms. The only caveat is that this ceiling fan does not have a remote control so make sure the fan is reachable to turn on and off.",2016-10-27
/p/Hunter-Oakhurst-52-in-LED-Indoor-Low-Profile-New-Bronze-Ceiling-Fan-with-Light-Kit-52016/300593306,300593306,"I don't know what's going on with this bought this yesterday, installed it but when I turn the switch on or off the part that holds the light bulbs jumps... I retuned it today cause I was told from (HD) that sounds like it's a manufactured defect. Got a new one and it's the same thing... I have installed 4 other in my house with no problems. Those four are Hampton Bay.. I will be returning this back.. also found out that Hunter makes Hampton's motor..",2017-04-05

Already had one in this spot (from the 90's) that stopped spinning, and I replaced the light box back then with a plastic ceiling fan bracket. So I had the nice bolts for the main bracket already there. Gotta have strength there, don't want it falling. Make sure you have all 3 wires through the center plate. Forgot the ground, off comes the plate. After you put on the motor and big outer cover... put on that thin top cover ring that covers the 4 screws NEXT. Had to remove 3 blades to get it up there. The access to blade holder screws are via a notch in the light holder. So the top plate can go hook left or right. Hook left and the notch is in the back if that matters. My notch was in back, nearer a table. Power screwdriver works wonders. Most screws stay in the holders by themselves (great), but not the 3 light screws. Magnetic screwdriver there a must. Blades, you MUST press hard on the back of the blade to get it to lock. But way better then 3 screws per blade. Plugged in light assembly, one bulb and it works ! Fan chain goes inside the ring for the light or else it will be very hard to pull. Three BRIGHT bulbs (supplied), but you still have thick frosted glass. I had a 150W CLF in the dome of the old fan, but these were still brighter. Without the cover it's really bright. Why the companies tint/frost the glass so much, I don't know. On 8' ceiling and when on high, this moves air. Medium is nice. Lights are all on or all off. Took an hour but I must have installed some 7 fans over the years. If this is to replace a regular light, got to get the top bracket on and bolted right. There are easy to add brackets for just a few bucks for a secure fit, no crawling in the attic. No wobble (make sure the fan arms click) and they are real easy to take off if needed. Silent, unless at top speed, then you hear the wind. This thing moves ! Reversible blades and direction, looks neat (old one was gold) , decent instructions (yea, I did read most of it). I have two other Hampton fans in the house and they are some 20+ years old.",2017-05-19

/p/Brookhurst-52-in-LED-Indoor-White-Ceiling-Fan-with-Light-Kit-YG268-WH/300937523,300937523,"In this price range I was a little concerned that the fan would be wobbly or noisy. NOT the case at all. I was familiar with Hampton Bay since I already had a more expensive fan made by them in my living room and it's been flawless. So I took a chance and ordered 5 of these for bedrooms, Am I glad I did! These are beautiful and operate so quietly you won't even know they are on, air flow is perfect. Installation took a little time with the first one but after that you find you can sort of pre-assemble the fan before installing and it goes up much faster. These are stylish and blend in any decor. Take a chance, you save lots of $$$ and
will be happy with your purchase for years to come.",2010-05-13
/p/Hunter-Channing-60-in-LED-Indoor-Brushed-Nickel-Ceiling-Fan-with-Light-Kit-54131/301009049,301009049,"This is a beautiful fan that is great for large rooms like we are using it in. We didn't know about the large size at first, but it turned out great. It not only looks nice but circulates the air well. Assembly and installation take a little time, as do all ceiling fans but it was pretty much normal since we were replacing another fan in the ceiling box. We have had good experiences with Hunter fans in previous homes. It has a lifetime warranty motor also. It comes with incandescent bulbs, which is a downside to me, but we bought LED bulbs for it since we have gone all LED in our home. It would be nice if they included LED bulbs.",2016-04-23

Most of the screws and bolts are already on the blades, and on the bracket,s,so you don,t have to guess which screws to use. Also the blade brackets have a guide post that falls right into the fan housing slot,s. It,s a can,t miss! For the every day handy man, this is the ticket. My wife love,s the design, the powerful air flow, and the light set. I have a fan in every room, but we like it so much, I might replace a few more with this fan, for they are nicer looking, as well as more powerful.The fan is very quite on most settings, on the high setting, it is very slightly noisy, but we can live with that.",2016-06-18

Great quality product. Not to many pieces to put together. Easy follow and clear instructions. It took two of us to install and it went up with no problem. I like the Brushed Nickel design. It has two chains that you can operate individually, one works the light and the other works the fan. The fan blades just snap into place and fit very securely. It moves lots of air in the bedroom where I installed it. It comes with 2 14 watt CFL bulbs. Powerful 3 speed reversible motor.

Installation of this fan was fairly easy and quick. The motor is very quiet, and doesn't wobble even on high speed. The blades are constructed of molded plastic which will make for easy cleaning. Compared with many other fans, with the increased blade pitch of the fan really moves the air in the room. This fan also comes with a remote that has many great features such as a built in thermostat and a forward/reverse function. My only negative comment would be that the price advertised online ($189.99) is much less than what I had paid in the store ($239.00).",2012-06-18

I put it up in my son's room and even though it's a huge inconvenience to uninstall and return it, we just can't live with the noise.

/p/Hunter-Aker-36-in-LED-Indoor-Fresh-White-Ceiling-Fan-with-Light-59301/301928144,301928144,"I recently installed a fan/light over the workbench in our outdoor workshop and was getting fed up with hitting my head on the on/off chain so I was very happy to discover this fan remote control. It was very easy to install with my existing fan and the remote provides a good range of fan control features including fan/light on/off, fan speed and even dims the lights if your fan has dimmable bulbs. The remote comes with a specially designed bracket which can be attached to the wall so you never lose the remote.

Installing the receiver/controller box in the fan was very straightforward using the included instructions. The design allows the control box to be hidden inside the top canopy cover that normally covers the fan mounting bracket and wires. It is very easy to wire up and the kit even includes new wire nuts. Once installed it is completely hidden from view which makes for a very tidy installation.

The remote control has a specially designed bracket that can be used to store the remote when not in use. The kit comes with a couple of screws or a double sided sticky pad to attach it to the wall. The remote has a range of up to 75' and the included battery will last up to 5 years according to the info on the packaging. Installing the battery in the remote will require a smaller Phillips screwdriver and even with the screw removed, the cover takes a bit of force to pry it off to fit the battery.

The remote provides a good range of control over the fan/light including:
Fan on/off
Light on/off
Fan speed
Light dimming (if dimmable bulbs are fitted to the fan light)

It comes with a 12 month warranty and can be used indoors our outside since the remote control is rated for use in damp environments.",2017-03-07

Installation was a bit harder than expected. Pretty hard to get the wireless receiver and all the wires into the canopy, especially while holding up the fan motor. Would be MUCH easier for 2 people. I was able to manage by first pushing all the household lines up into the ceiling to minimize bulk, putting the receiver into the mounting bracket (can do this if flush mounting - not sure if this would work if doing standard mount), then taping the motor wires into a single cable and wrapping around the mounting bracket.

2. Remote with light dimmer works great. Light dims when you hold down the button - doesn't say this in the instructions. Even if you turn on/off power from wall switch, it remembers your last setting.

3. Light is not bright but as good as you could expect from 2 x 60W candelabras. Looking at reviews of an older version, I think this has been improved.

4. Absolutely no wobble, and no balancing was necessary.

5. Motor has mild electrical hum, only really noticeable on high speed.",2012-08-05

Everything from the double sided ABS material blades to the silicone sealed pull chains and reverse switch are designed to help this unit resist water. There is even a plug to seal the access hole needed for installing the blade brackets.
 I REALLY like the slide on mounting bracket. After attaching this to the ceiling electrical box and, following the clear directions for preparing the motor, you can slide the downrod ball, with motor attached, into the mount and let go. This allows you to connect the wiring without holding up the motor. Should you instead need a flush to ceiling mounting, there is a hook in the mounting bracket to hold the fan motor while you connect the wiring. The fan blades attach quickly without tools and are both quiet and wobble free. The total height of the fan with light is approx. 15" flush mount and 19" with supplied downrod. Longer downrods (standard 3/4" diameter) are available at Home Depot. The light kit attaches easily (2 wire plug in connectors) and holds two 9 Watt (60 watt replacement) LED bulbs which are supplied. Energy consumption estimate is an incredible $10/year at 2 hours use a day. This fan/light looks good and moves a very nice amount of air quietly and efficiently. Wet use is perfect for our weather exposed lanai. Totally happy and strongly recommend.",2019-02-20

The LED light is a 20 Watt LED which is around 180 Watt equivalency. We replaced a light only that was 2 (60 Watt) incandescent bulbs, that gives us 50% more Wattage while using less than 25% of the electricity, a nice savings.
This includes a remote, that works out well for us because we put it on a high ceiling where a pull chain would be inconvenient.
The instructions for installing this light and using the remote control are excellent, top tier.
I have done many fans but I still went through the installation instructions before I started, then followed them step by step and it was a breeze installing this. One of the easiest ceiling fan I have installed.
Having an LED light kit like this one is great for the energy savings but also wonderful because the light is extremely light weight.
This fan has 3 blades and we did install it in a bedroom about 12' X 12' and the wind created from this fan is more than adequate for this room, even with the 12' ceilings. The fan is rated for up to 10' X 10' rooms but as I said, it worked well for our larger room.

I bought 2 silver ones for a more modern look and a white one for the room where I wanted it to blend in a little more.

On this fan Quickfit installation includes a slide on mounting bracket and a twist and lock shade which both save time. Wiring was easy; just connect the black, white, and ground wires from the remote sensor to the outlet box wires with included wire nuts. Wires from the remote sensor to the fan motor and light kit come with plugs for easy connection. An extension wire is also provided for use of longer down rods. The fan includes a very responsive remote that controls the 3 selectable fan speeds and dimmable LED light. The fan runs smoothly at all speeds and moves a significant amount of air. The 3000K LED light is very nice and bright at the highest setting and dimmable. I prefer composite fan blades but the wooden blades on this fan are very attractive. I find this to be an excellent high quality modern looking fan to enhance my kitchen.",2021-03-09

White isn't my color and especially right in the middle of the room mounted on a white ceiling, I collect oil lamps and enjoy some color. only thing I recommend is that you read the instructions or go online to watch the installation video. From start to finish it took me about 1 hour. That was removing the old fan, installing the new fan and attaching everything. My installation was a bit different as the ceiling box is only 1/2" deep which didn't allow for as much wire as the fan comes with. I made a few modifications and it worked great.

Installation was quick and easy thanks to the video found in the “Product Overview” section of the Home depot website. The 5 speeds on the fan and 6 for the light let me customize it to my specific needs. The fan/light uses only 21 ½ watts, or $6 estimated yearly power usage, ranking it among the lowest energy users according to the federal ENERGYGUIDE listing, which goes from $3 to $34 per year. I was somewhat disappointed with the light output, even on the brightest 6500k setting. It reminded me of the round fluorescent light my mother had in her kitchen in the early to mid-60’s, but overall, I am completely satisfied with it. If you’ve never owned one, the DC component takes a little getting used to. The first thing you will probably notice is the delay when turning it on. I set mine up so that when I flip the switch, both the light and fan come on. There is about a one second delay for the light to come on instead of the instantaneous results you are probably used to, and the fan goes back and forth trying to decide which way it wants to turn, but I understand that this is completely normal, and just takes some getting used to.

Installation is straight forward and can be easily completed by the average do-it-yourselfer. Unlike some of the newer fans that integrate smart controls and remotes, the Claret has basic wiring that will be compatible with 98% of homes.

This fan will not flush mount and a 4.5” downrod is included. It is compatible with longer downrods if desired. The “quiet motor” is a legitimate claim which is very important to me as it’s replacing a humming bedroom fan.

This one features a receiver prewired and integrated into the motor housing.  That eliminates some wiring and having to stuff the receiver and wires into the bracket cavity and canopy space.  Now you can push all the wiring with wire nuts up into the electrical box where they belong with little effort.  Make sure you cap the blue wire by itself if your fan is controlled at one versus two switches.  This blue wire is NOT for light control like the blue wire on many other fans.  It is the second “traveler” in a 3-way switch arrangement.  Installing the blades is also made easier with preinstalled center screws that initially locate the blade and hold it in place while you install the two outer screws.  One blade did have a slightly deformed slot that required removing the center screw to get the blade in place.  I was able to reinstall the screw at the end of the slot.  The light fixture installs with 3 screws for the outer housing followed by just two push-together connectors that you can’t get wrong.   Then you finish the installation with 3 more screws.  There is no capacitor or other wiring in the way making the job simpler.  The lens twists into place and drops into slots.  The fan is extremely quiet even on high and air movement is excellent from the curved blades.  I did have to balance the blades to remove a moderate amount of wobble and it did take a while.    The finish is even and free of flaws.  The remote control not only controls the light on/off and the fan but also controls the direction of the fan as well as dimming and an audible beep when changes are made.  Hunter’s years of fan design experience show in this model but I would still like to see all fans separated from the remotes and receivers so the customer can select a traditional remote or Bluetooth & Wi-Fi remote as an option.  As of now, it appears Hunter fans require something that looks like a hub to operate their Wi-Fi remote.  Seems like they should be looking at options to put everything necessary to connect to a home hub such as Wink, SmartThings and so on.

Hunter Port Isabel 52 in. LED Indoor/Outdoor Matte Black Ceiling Fan with Light Kit

We have a covered porch that I put a regular fan on a few years back, it now looks like some weird art sculpture. This Hunter fan is “Damp” rated which means it can take high humidity which causes most problems, such as drooping blades.

It was easy to install the motor and light but the assembly of the blades with their mounting brackets was a bit rough. There are 9 pieces (3 screws, 3 nuts, and 3 rubber grommets) per blade instead of the usual 3 screws per blade and they will only fit one way.

Make sure you install everything in order or you may wind up having to remove something to get the right part on. Such as if you put the light base on before the blades.

It has a “Weathered” blade finish that makes them look as if they have been there for years. 

The black plastic cages cover the Edison style LED bulbs, really looks good at night. See photo.

The pull chains are clearly marked which is light and which is fan.

I like it because it doesn't hand down too far, so I can walk under it. The design is a bit different. The fan blade mounting is hidden after you put the light kit on. There is a snap on trim piece that hides the screws that hold the fan to the mounting plate. This gives you a nice, clean look. The light module takes edison base LED lamps. It comes with a pair of 60w equivalent lamps. I plan on upgrading them to 100w equivalent ones.

Installation is easy for the most part. The mounting plate has rubber pads that push against the ceiling. The mounting plate has two "hooks" that hold the fan while you wire it. There is plenty of room for the wires in the top of the fan. The only hard part is tightening the screws that hold the light in place. The wires tend to hide the screws.

You have to use the light module that comes with the fan. It is where the pull chains are. There is a male and female connector that connects the fan to the light module that takes care os power and control.",2022-04-27

Taking the time to start the screws proved to be the best way to get them started.",2021-12-25

Only negative, the Shade is plastic, but with the light being LED, it does not generate the heat of an Incandescent.  So, likely will not make it brittle or turn yellow.   It is nice to be able to choose the Temperature of the light.  It has 3 preset Temps (3000K, 4000K and 5000K) and 3 preset Speeds (1834, 3634 and 5235 CFM).  I have installed this in my Bedroom.  So, will use the 3000K, which is a mellower, going to bed, light.  The blades are a reversible (tea stained oak and oil rubbed oak).  Both brown colors, one just slightly darker.  The Energy Guide Rating seems pretty good for an AC Motor.  Remote works fine and paired easily with my Bond (which makes it Smart).",2022-05-16

The fan is very nice looking and when you finally get it installed it is very quiet and moves a fair amount of air.  The remote makes it do all sorts of things too, including six speeds and running it backwards.
Now for the cons: They don't supply a battery for the remote!  Well, you say, just grab a AA cell from the kid's toy and move on.  No, sorry. It's a 12 VOLT 1/2 AA size battery and even worse, they don't tell you what the part number is!  Turns out it's an A23 battery. Not one a US household would just have laying around.  Any by the way, the fan will do NOTHING when you first power it up unless you use the remote. 
The next "con" is to do with the hanger rod.  They supply 2 rods. One 4 inch and one around 10 inches.  Well good luck using the short one.  It can be done, but very difficult because all the covers have to be down at the bottom while you hang it and get the controller and wires stuffed in,  I just used the longer one!  
The rods seem to be a standard design that can be easily found at HD.  However, if you require a rod longer than12 inches you won't have enough wire to feed through it and still make connections to the controller (which MUST be installed at the top next to the ceiling).
Another general gripe, is assembly of this fan is very very tedious.  I can't even count how many fans I have installed over the years and this one was a total pain.  The whole blade frame thing is all screwed together plus 3 tiny screws in each or 8 blades.  The "lead in" on the frame tapped holes is pretty much non-existent so when starting a screw you have to go really slow and careful so you don't cross thread them.
The good news, as I said, is once all that stuff is done, the fan seems to work pretty well.  The LED light is at least as bright as an incandescent version.  It remembers the light and fan setting when you power off at the wall. So you don't have to scramble for the remote if you are just passing through the room.",2022-08-28

This fan installs differently than all the other ceiling fans I have installed. It is assembled PRIOR to hanging it from the ceiling, so you don't have to balance on a high ladder while attaching blades, etc. You just have to climb the ladder to screw in the  hanger and then you insert the downrod, connect the wiring, raise the canopy and you're done!

The blade design is a modern rectangular shape that fits flush with the motor body, no old-fashioned spindly arms extending from the motor to the fan blades. The first picture shows the blades attached to the pieces that later attach to the motor. Each blade is attached with three screws with washers that are included in the kit. The side of the blade you are viewing in that picture shows the top side of the blades, which is a weathered wood finish. I wanted the black finished side to show when the fan is mounted, and it is underneath. 

The second picture shows how the blades are attached to the motor. The cardboard packing that came with the fan makes an excellent base to hold the motor securely and you can see it in the second picture. Here, the motor is  upside down, and you see what will be the exposed side of the blades. This position is also used to install the light unit, which went on next. THe camera made the blade surface look brown, but it is a black, woodgrain finish.

Then, I turned the assembly right side up and still on top of that cardboard packing, installed the downrod and canopy. The fan came with a 6" downrod - if you need something longer, extensions are available, but be sure you get one that is specified for a DC - powered fan!

Finally, I had to climb a ladder to attach the ceiling hanger, which was easy, and then I climbed the ladder again, holding the assembled fan in one hand to insert the downrod into the hanger. The fan is fairly light, and I'm 81 years old, and I had no trouble doing this task.

The only fiddly bit was inserting the transformer into the hanger, because the clearances are small. You then connect three wires with the included wire nuts, plug the transformer into the fan motor, raise the canopy and you're done!

The last picture shows the fan in operation. The fan paired with the remote immediately. The light can be adjusted to different brightness levels and color intensities, from daylight to soft light, all from the remote. Likewise, the remote turns the fan on and off, changes its speed and reverses it when the seasons change. There's even a "random varying speed" feature, that is supposed to resemble a soft breeze. The fan is dead quiet and there is NO wobble, at any speed.",2022-09-17

There is ample space for wiring and the remote receiver in the fan housing.  This is a large fan, so it can be used in a large (to medium) sized room.  The fan retains its settings, so it can be simply turned on/off at the wall switch and it will continue operation with the last settings.  The DC motor is smooth and quiet.  The fan does not wobble and is very stable.  Because it is DC the direction can be reversed using the remote.

Not in this case. In this case, I will begin by saying that despite the low price, this fan exceeds my expectations.

Pros:
- wood blades.  Real wood!  Beautiful and solid.
- instantly elevates the look of the room with the clean lines, rich wood blades and minimal style
- we had existing wiring from previous fans, so there was no new electrical work needed, but our contractor had zero issues with installing these
- QUIET !  Extremely quiet - - - so much so that I need to visually check that they're turned off when we leave because they don't make a sound even when they're at full speed
- I'd wondered if 3 blades would be as efficient as our old 5 blade fans and they are even more so.  Perhaps it's the curved style of the blades themselves, but unless we're trying to quickly cool the room down, we don't have it at top speed.   Papers blow around off the table at speed 6.
- I love how the light is flush with the fan.  This was the hardest feature to find when I was shopping for new fans.  So many fans have the light fixture protruding down below the fan.  I wanted a cleaner look and did not want the light to hang below the level of the fan.  This design is perfect and beautiful.  Bonus points because the light cover, although plastic, is matte frosted.  It doesn't look like cheap plastic when the light is off, and it cuts the glare of the light (even at the brightest setting) when the light is on
- the adjustability of the light color temp is fantastic.  For me, the warm is too yellow and the cool is too blue.  Just like Goldilocks, the middle daylight temp is juuuust right.
- the light dims smoothly and easily with no flicker at all.  Bonus that the remote remembers the last light setting the next time you turn it on.
- the remote functions smoothly and well.  We have 2 fans in rooms adjacent to each other and our contractor was a bit concerned they may interfere with each other.  They do not.  They each function independently with no confusion . . . although, it would be nice to have the ability to sync one remote to control more than one fan.  I'd love to be able to have one remote in my hand and wander into several rooms to turn on each fan without having to find the remote in each room.  That's just a wish list item though.  It certainly doesn't take away from how pleased I am with these fans.
Cons:
- honestly, there are none except for my wish-list mentioned above about being able to use one remote for more than one fan.",2023-07-12

It’s a significant improvement in so many ways!  It’s putting out significantly BETTER BREEZE (60” vs. original 52” span), MORE EFFICIENT (variable LED vs. original incandescent lights; DC motor with multi-speeds vs. original 3-speed AC motor).  Comparing a DC to AC motor ceiling fan: DC uses up to 70% less energy than a standard AC fan and are EXTREMELY QUIET.  The quality is good, wood blades balanced on first go.  The remote is much handier than our old pullchain/switch operation; the LEDs have variable color to match our recessed lighting; and there’s even an app for “smart” use.  VERY SATISFIED with all these improvements!  

The installation guide is available on the HD website.  We had to purchase a 3-ft Carro-brand downrod from Home Depot for our application (it’s a different diameter from a standard downrod).  We found it at CARRO 36 in. Black Extension downrod for DC Ceiling Fan DR36B (homedepot.com).  We figured it out, but it came with no instructions- we had to remove the ball from the included 6-in rod and shorten the mounting pin.  The 3-ft downrod came with an extended wiring harness and a longer safety cable but a different design than the included shorter cable ends.  FYI, using the 3-ft downrod places the bottom of the blades at 3’8” and the bottom of the light at 3’10”.  

Contrary to the assembly instructions, we opted to do the installation without the blades and light kit attached (we were working on a 12-ft stepladder and it would have been unwieldy).",2022-10-20

The fan was packaged well from the factory. The manual is easy to read/understand. The installation took me about 30 minutes. It does not come with bracket screws to attach to your light box. You need to reuse the ones you have or purchase them new.
The over design and quality is nice and very clean. 
During the install, you first, run wires through the bracket, and secure the bracket to the light box. Next hang the fan motor on the bracket, make your connections then attach the motor to the bracket with four screws. Install the shroud. Next prepare all your fans blades for mounting. Choose the dark brown or gray side on the fan blades. Attach the fans to the motor. 
The light assembly is thin and very sharp. Get the screw in the bag between the two wires on the light assembly. Install it for the light cover as it's harder to do after it's installed. On my other installs, it was easier to just install the leds and the light globe during this phase because of how the three screws holding the light globe are a little harder to get to just behind the thinly sharp metal. 
You have to remove the three screws around the light fixture, next attach the wires from the light to the fan. Then organize the wires being careful not to cut them, then use a magnetic screw driver to help guide the three small screws into the light fixture.
Next, test the light. The chains come with a pendant with a fan and a light. Use the appropriate pull chain/pendant for the correct feature.
Lastly, the metal has a gloss to it. If you touched it, more than likely your fingerprints will still be on it. You may want to wipe down the metal pieces when you are done.
I did notice that the led bulbs were not daylight. It was at first bright but not as bright as I would like. I would say it was semi dim. I changed out the bulbs for daylight version and that did help it out a little it honestly was not bright enough for my liking. I decided that in my main areas, I like these fan where there are other lights being utilized. I decided to not use them in any of the bedrooms. I am returning four out of the seven.
Pros:
1. Very well made. The fan is nice quality gun metal.
2. Instructions are very clear.
3. Installation was easy.
4. Comes with two led bulbs.
5. 15 Year Limited Warranty - motor.

Cons:
1. The light assembly is thin and sharp.
2. The led bulbs are not daylight and is honestly not very bright with the glass dome installed. Even if you install daylight bulbs, I found it to be dim compared to downward facing light fixtures.
3. Metal attracts fingerprints.",2023-05-09

And this fan is genuinely the worst fan that i've ever owned, on pretty much every front. My goodness.

INSTALLATION
Installation is unnecessarily complex.  Multiple pieces have to be pre-assembled onto the main shaft prior to hanging.  I had to remove the fan and disassemble the shaft multiple times, as i forgot one piece or another.  The manual provides a wiring diagram, but it is woefully inefficient, an doesn't show where the main remote receiver is actually supposed to sit.  I was lucky to be installing this in a covered outdoor location, so i had plenty of external room to mount the receiver.  But if you're doing this indoors, or without lots of internal ceiling space, you're in serious trouble.

The fan blades are mounted after the motor assembly is already installed. This means that you have to install one blade on a time, upside-down, on a ladder. Not great.

Installation took me over an hour, where it should have been 15 minutes tops.


DESIGN
There are all sorts of design issues with the fan.  The main motor housing + light is not nearly heavy enough.  This means when the fan is spinning, there is not a high center of gravity pulling the fan parallel with the ground.  The slightest breeze (as this is installed outside) and the fan sways, with the blades getting perilously close to the ceiling.  It's only a matter of time before this fan destroys itself.

The blades themselves are straight black plastic.  They are light, with an incredibly cheap look and feel.  It almost looks like a toy.

Once assembled, the entire fan just looks SMALL.  Yes, it's 52".  But with the thin blades, and the TINY light, it really looks odd, almost like a toy, against the ceiling.

The light is woefully inefficient.  It should be bigger and brighter.

REMOTE
Having a remote for your fan is great.  But not this remote.  This thing is a masterclass in how you DON'T design a remote.

First off, the design of the remote is incredibly strange, with a rounded bottom, and a very thin top.
It's also super light and incredibly cheap.  Holding it in your hand, when you press a button with your thumb, you can feel the actual body of the remote twist and bend in your hand.
The battery cover comes off too easily, and the mounting bracket for this is a joke.
Functionally, there are WAAAY too many features on this remote.  You're just kind of hunting and pecking, hoping a button you press will get the fan to a state you want it in.  This is the first time in my life that i've had to reference a manual on what the different buttons did on a remote, as they are not intuitive in the least.

While i appreciate the ability to change the color temperature of the LED, having this on the remote is completely unnecessary, as is having the fan reverse.
These are functions that once selected, are very rarely accessed.  You'll inevitably accidentally press these buttons while you're trying to do something else, and then get frustrated.

Additionally, the dimmer is extremely difficult to control, and you don't really know where you're at with it.

SUMMARY

I could go on, but i've written enough. This fan is just terrible all around. From complicated installation, to poor design of both the fan and the remote, i'm quite disappointed.  With literally hundred of fan options out there, i absolutely cannot recommend this fan from Hampton Bay.",2023-05-12

Not in this case. In this case, I will begin by saying that despite the low price, this fan exceeds my expectations.

Pros:
- wood blades.  Real wood!  Beautiful and solid.
- instantly elevates the look of the room with the clean lines, rich wood blades and minimal style
- we had existing wiring from previous fans, so there was no new electrical work needed, but our contractor had zero issues with installing these
- QUIET !  Extremely quiet - - - so much so that I need to visually check that they're turned off when we leave because they don't make a sound even when they're at full speed
- I'd wondered if 3 blades would be as efficient as our old 5 blade fans and they are even more so.  Perhaps it's the curved style of the blades themselves, but unless we're trying to quickly cool the room down, we don't have it at top speed.   Papers blow around off the table at speed 6.
- I love how the light is flush with the fan.  This was the hardest feature to find when I was shopping for new fans.  So many fans have the light fixture protruding down below the fan.  I wanted a cleaner look and did not want the light to hang below the level of the fan.  This design is perfect and beautiful.  Bonus points because the light cover, although plastic, is matte frosted.  It doesn't look like cheap plastic when the light is off, and it cuts the glare of the light (even at the brightest setting) when the light is on
- the adjustability of the light color temp is fantastic.  For me, the warm is too yellow and the cool is too blue.  Just like Goldilocks, the middle daylight temp is juuuust right.
- the light dims smoothly and easily with no flicker at all.  Bonus that the remote remembers the last light setting the next time you turn it on.
- the remote functions smoothly and well.  We have 2 fans in rooms adjacent to each other and our contractor was a bit concerned they may interfere with each other.  They do not.  They each function independently with no confusion . . . although, it would be nice to have the ability to sync one remote to control more than one fan.  I'd love to be able to have one remote in my hand and wander into several rooms to turn on each fan without having to find the remote in each room.  That's just a wish list item though.  It certainly doesn't take away from how pleased I am with these fans.
Cons:
- honestly, there are none except for my wish-list mentioned above about being able to use one remote for more than one fan.",2023-07-12

We were replacing an old fan in our sunroom, which is enclosed but not temperature controlled, so the fan is very important. We originally bought another fan from another brand, but the electrician was unable to get it installed without major wobbling (despite hours of trying). We returned that one.

I have three of their fans, so when I wanted one for my covered porch, this is the only brand I will buy. I love the design of this fan- the modern twist to a classic design.    The instructions are easy to follow and the fan is easy to put together. The mounting plate has a small hook that you can hang the motor assembly on while you hook up the wiring – brilliant!  The blades are plastic (but don’t look like it), so the fan is light but you should still install a ceiling mount fan box and do not use a plastic one to ensure the stability of the fan when it is running.  One confusing item when installing the fan was the safety rope and the light fixture.  It was a little difficult to get the safety rope through the hole in the light fixture – to the point that I thought I was installing it wrong – I wasn’t. Besides that little hiccup, it took about 45 minutes to install the fan and get it setup on my network.  So why do I love Carro Fans? For every reason that this fan has – high quality build, quiet when running, an intuitive remote control, easy to control, ability to change the light color and fan speed at a touch of a button, a ‘nature’ feature that simulates a natural breeze gentle enough not to disturb you while you sleep, and smart technology.

It looks and works great and we are happy with it and it met our expectations.  There are a few things I learned doing the install.  First of all, the LED bulbs that come with the fan are not "dimmable" but can be easily replaced with dimmable bulbs.  Also, if you need to attach the ceiling bracket with wood screws, get better screws than what is included with the fan.  The Phillips slots in the screws stripped out before the 3 inch screws ever got tight in the support structure and I had to use vice grips to remove the screws and replace them with a better quality screws.  Also, the Installation Manual suggests that you "carefully push the switch housing components into the switch housing".  There was no way to make these fit and install the cover and I did the best I could and then didn't install the cover.  This did not show when the globe is installed on the light looked fine.

The discreet ceiling fan within has a beautiful translucent wood grain and a brushed gold metal center. It’s so much prettier than the old-style ceiling fan it replaced. 
I put this in my bedroom in which I am happy to now have a remote to control from bed. You can turn the power on and off from a wall switch, however, when you do, it resets to default setting- light on, fan off, rotate forward, speed 1, beeps on, so if you had the fan on 3 in reverse, beeps muted when you turned it off, that all clears. If running the fan regularly, it’s better to use the remote to turn off/on because that does remember both the fan and light last settings and returns to them. 
Mfr. should stop stating that it works with a dimmer switch because it’s misleading. Sure, you can have a dimmer switch, but you must keep it up at full power. There’s only one set of wires to connect to the receiver, not separate light and fan connections, therefore the receiver exclusively controls both dimming and fan speeds, and it requires full 110-120v to operate properly. Secondly, note that the remote has NO dimming. You cannot long-press the light on/off button to dim. I dock a point for any modern ceiling fan missing this. Otherwise, the remote is quite full-featured, allowing for separate fan and light mgmt., auto-all-off times, reverse and even a beep mute button.  I put 25w (equiv.) bulbs in it. It makes such dramatic patterns all over the ceiling and walls! 
I was hoping the 6 speeds would have super low speeds at 1-2 but that’s not the case. It blows very fast even at 1. This type of tiny fan blows only directly below it anyway, so I find that reversing the fan softens the air movement and spreads it throughout the room nicely for sleeping below it. The fan has a soft white noise whir even at 1, but not disturbing. The whir gets louder with each speed but I can’t imagine ever using more than 1 or 2 while sleeping. This fan has no leveling capability and my ceiling is not level so the fan vibrates a bit.
Installation is a 2-person job. The fixture comes fully assembled and attaches to a light fixture plate, not a fan bracket, so someone must hold the fixture up for you while you connect the 3 wires. I like that the ceiling plate has a slotted circle so I could align the bars in the fixture to the room walls just how I wanted. I had to poke the source wires through the holes in the plate to connect in the fixture canopy because the plate circle completely covers my 4in. ceiling box. Despite no dimming, I love this elegant fandelier!",2024-02-05

The finish in matte black makes for a nice elegance as compared to typical wood/chrome/white alternatives.  The blades are wood, and all of the central parts are metal.  The globe for the light is frosted glass.

It moves a decent amount of air but is very quiet at doing so.  Even on high speed, it is extremely quiet except for the sound of air moving.

Lightwise, I have a small amount of dissapointment (thus the four stars).  Light output I would equate to a 60 watt light bulb.  And it is the warm color tone, so yellow-y.  I have the fan hung in a smaller room, maybe 10x10 and it provides enough light but I would not have wanted it to be in a larger room where this was the only light source.  It would be nice if there were changable light options for other color tones, and/or brightness levels.  This is far from a deal breaker though.

Installation was fairly straigh forward.  Especially if you have ever hung a ceiling fan before.  The kit comes with a short and a long downrod, as well as all of the screws necessary to attach the fan to your electrical box.  Additionall, there is a balancing kit in case your fan has a small wobble.  My fan was almost perfectly balanced, so no adjustment was needed.

Using the ceiling hugger rod does make the space tight for install, but if you get everything set up before it is hung, this isnt too bad.

My only complaint with install is that it seems like the instruction book was either meant for another product, or is just generic images.  Again, if you have ever hung a fan before it shouldnt be an issue.  Just look over all the parts before you begin assembling.  The biggest things were the three trim rings that go between the motor and ceiling, just figuring out which went on first.",2024-05-04

Everything is in the box and the instructions are simple, I would recommend having 2 people for the installation.  The light kit is small in form and the finish on the fan and light are very clean.
